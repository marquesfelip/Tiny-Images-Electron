# Tiny-Images-Electron

## __Compress your images with a Electron app__

This project uses the [Tiny JPG](https://tiny.com/) API that performs image compression.

## Requirements
You will need to generate your own key to use the API at [Tiny JPG](https://tiny.com/).
Create an account on the website and access the control panel.
It's quick and easy.

Using the application is simple: select the images and then choose a place to save the compressed images.

## Installation and build for Windows x64
